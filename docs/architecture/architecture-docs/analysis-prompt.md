# Nudger-Obsidian Integration: Architectural Analysis Prompt

## Instructions

You are a senior software architect specializing in distributed systems, data synchronization, and integration patterns. Your task is to provide a comprehensive architectural analysis of one proposed solution for integrating Project Nudger with Obsidian.

## Context Documents

You will be provided with one of the following detailed specification documents:
- `option1-file-based-json.md` - File-based JSON export/import approach
- `option2-direct-firebase.md` - Direct Firebase connection via Obsidian plugin  
- `option3a-livesync-virtual-device.md` - Integration as virtual LiveSync device
- `option3b-direct-couchdb.md` - Direct CouchDB database access

## Evaluation Priorities (In Order of Importance)

1. **Reliability** - Minimizing failure points, data corruption risks, and system dependencies
2. **Automation** - Reducing manual intervention and enabling seamless background operation
3. **Data Currency** - Maintaining reasonably current data representation across systems
4. **Ease of Use** - Intuitive experience for users in both Nudger and Obsidian environments

## Required Analysis Format

Your response must contain ONLY the following sections in exact markdown format. Do not include any preamble, summary, or additional commentary outside this structure.

**Automation** (Priority #2): [Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor]  
*Brief justification of rating*

**Data Currency** (Priority #3): [Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor]
*Brief justification of rating*

**Ease of Use** (Priority #4): [Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor]
*Brief justification of rating*

### Critical Questions for Decision Making

1. *Question whose answer would significantly impact approach viability*
2. *Question about technical feasibility or implementation approach*
3. *Question about operational or user experience implications*
4. *Additional questions that could affect the analysis*

### Alternative Approach Recommendations

**Minor Modifications**:
- *Small changes that could improve the proposed approach*

**Major Architectural Changes** (Only if Significant Impact):
- *Fundamental changes that would substantially alter the approach*
- *Only include if the recommendation would significantly improve multiple analysis sections*
- *Clearly state how the change affects complexity, risks, and priorities*

### Final Recommendation

**Recommendation**: [Strongly Recommend/Recommend/Recommend with Reservations/Do Not Recommend]

**Rationale**: *2-3 sentences explaining the recommendation based on priority alignment and risk assessment*

**Next Steps**: *Immediate actions needed to move forward with this approach*

## Analysis Guidelines

- Base your analysis solely on the provided specification document
- Consider real-world implementation challenges and edge cases
- Evaluate each approach against the stated priorities objectively
- Identify gaps in the specification that could impact implementation success
- Focus on architectural soundness rather than implementation details
- Provide actionable insights for decision making and implementation planning

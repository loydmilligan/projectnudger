# PROJECT CONTEXT - Project Nudger

## Project Overview
- **Name**: Project Nudger
- **Description**: An opinionated task management application designed to combat project neglect and procrastination through a weighted priority system and an escalating series of notifications
- **Tech Stack**: React 19.1.0 + Vite 6.3.5 + Firebase Firestore + Tailwind CSS + Web Bluetooth + AI Integration + @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- **Current Status**: Phase 1 UI Polish Complete - Moving to Phase 2 Enhanced Project Information

## Recent Completion
- **Just Completed**: Task-1.5 - Project Card Layout Optimization
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Optimized ProjectsView grid layout with enhanced responsive breakpoints
  - Reduced gap from 24px to 16px for tighter spacing
  - Enhanced column progression (1→2→3→4) for better screen utilization
  - Added medium breakpoint for improved tablet experience
  - Better integration with ProgressBar components from Task-1.2
- **Current Baseline**: codebase_manifest.json v1.4 with optimized layout

## Development Workflow
You are working with a manifest-driven development workflow. Available commands:
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/process_task2.md "Task-X.X"` (prepare task for implementation)
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/implement_task2.md "Task-X.X"` (implement prepared task)
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/check_task2.md "Task-X.X"` (validate implementation)
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/commit_task2.md "Task-X.X"` (commit and update baseline)
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/resolve_mismatch2.md "Task-X.X"` (fix validation issues)
- `@/home/mmariani/.claude/commands/update_final_manifest_v2.md` (update architectural planning)

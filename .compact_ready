# PROJECT CONTEXT - Project Nudger

## Continue Development
`claude-code process_task "Task-1.3"`

## Just Completed & Committed
- **Task**: Task-2.2 - Archive Filter Improvements
- **Summary**: Added 'Show Archived' toggle to hide archived projects by default with session storage persistence
- **Commit**: ec2d15d
- **Files Changed**: 2 files modified, 1 validation report created
- **Status**: Successfully completed, validated, and committed

## Project Status
- **Name**: Project Nudger
- **Description**: An opinionated task management application designed to combat project neglect and procrastination through a weighted priority system and an escalating series of notifications
- **Tech Stack**: React 19.1.0 + Vite 6.3.5 + Firebase Firestore + Tailwind CSS + Web Bluetooth + AI Integration + @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- **Development Phase**: Phase 1 completion (4/5 tasks done) - Moving to critical task fixes
- **Baseline**: codebase_manifest.json updated with Task-2.2 changes (version 1.6)

## Current Architecture
**Key Components**: ProjectsView with dual-mode display (grid/kanban), KanbanBoard with drag-and-drop, ProjectFilters with comprehensive filtering, TaskItem with hierarchical display, EnhancedTimerWidget with Pomodoro functionality, AI-powered RecommendationEngine
**Recent Changes**: Added archive filtering with 'Show Archived' toggle, session storage persistence, and enhanced project filtering logic that excludes archived projects by default
**Integration Points**: Archive filter integrates with existing owner/stage filters, works in both grid and kanban modes, persists user preferences across sessions

## Task Progress
### Recently Completed
- Task-1.1: Enhanced Due Date Filters UI Integration (past due and nudged task filters)
- Task-1.2: Task Completion Visual Progress Indicators (progress bars and completion styling)
- Task-1.4: Fix Kanban Board Drop Functionality (drag-and-drop project stage movement)
- Task-1.5: Project Card Layout Optimization (responsive breakpoints and spacing)
- Task-2.1: Project View Enhanced Details (task count displays and project age indicators)
- Task-2.2: Archive Filter Improvements (hide archived projects by default with toggle)

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - UI Polish and Missing Features
**Progress**: 5/5 tasks completed (Task-1.1, Task-1.2, Task-1.4, Task-1.5 completed + Task-2.1, Task-2.2 from Phase 2)
**Status**: Phase 1 complete, moving to critical bug fixes

### Next Recommended Task
**Task**: Task-1.3 - Fix Task Editing and Add Delete Functionality
**Priority**: critical
**Description**: Fix bug where some tasks cannot be edited from TasksView and add missing delete task functionality with confirmation
**Dependencies**: None (independent task)
**Estimated Effort**: 75 minutes

## Development Workflow
You have access to manifest-driven development commands:

**Core Workflow:**
- `claude-code process_task "Task-X.X"` - Prepare task for implementation
- `claude-code implement_task "Task-X.X"` - Implement prepared task  
- `claude-code check_task "Task-X.X"` - Validate implementation against expected
- `claude-code commit_task "Task-X.X"` - Commit and update baseline
- `claude-code resolve_mismatch "Task-X.X"` - Fix validation issues

**Optimization:**
- `claude-code compact_after_task "Task-X.X"` - Create compact context after completion
- `claude-code commit_task_then_compact "Task-X.X"` - Commit and create compact context

## Project Structure
- **Baseline Manifest**: codebase_manifest.json (updated with Task-2.2 changes, version 1.6)
- **Task Definitions**: tasks/tasks.json
- **Completed Tasks**: tasks/completed/
- **Documentation**: README.md, docs/ directory with comprehensive architecture documentation

## Current Git State
- **Latest Commit**: ec2d15d - Task-2.2 completion
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Clean working directory, ready for next task

## Important Development Notes
**Critical Priority**: Task-1.3 is marked as critical priority and addresses fundamental task management functionality that users depend on. This should be tackled before other enhancements.

**Recent Architecture Decision**: Archive filtering was implemented with session storage (not localStorage) to provide per-session behavior that resets when users start fresh sessions, preventing confusion about missing projects.

**Performance Consideration**: Archive filtering uses useMemo optimization and applies archive filter before stage filter for maximum efficiency with large archived project counts.

**UI Pattern**: The project uses a consistent color-coding system: red for past due, orange for nudged, blue for archived, maintaining visual hierarchy and user recognition.

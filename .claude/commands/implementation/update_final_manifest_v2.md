## Task: Update Proposed Final Manifest

**Trigger:** [Milestone completion/Architectural discovery/Drift detection/Periodic review]

## Update Process:

### 1. Analyze Implementation Learnings
- Review recently completed tasks and their outcomes
- Examine any resolved mismatches and their resolutions
- Identify architectural patterns that emerged during implementation
- Note new requirements, features, or constraints discovered
- Assess changes in dependencies, tools, or integration approaches

### 2. Compare Current vs. Proposed States
- **Load Current State**: Read codebase_manifest.json (actual implemented state)
- **Load Target State**: Read docs/proposed_final_manifest.json (planned target)
- **Identify Gaps**: Compare actual vs. proposed to find significant differences
- **Assess Drift**: Determine if differences indicate evolution or problems

### 3. Categorize Architectural Evolution

#### üîç **Implementation Discoveries:**
- **Better Patterns Found**: Superior architectural approaches discovered during coding
- **API Improvements**: Better function signatures or interfaces identified
- **Performance Optimizations**: Architecture changes that improve performance
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Improved error management patterns
- **Integration Improvements**: Better ways to connect with external systems

#### üìà **Scope Evolution:**
- **Feature Additions**: New capabilities that proved necessary during implementation
- **Feature Removals**: Planned features that proved unnecessary or problematic
- **Requirement Changes**: External requirements that changed project direction
- **Technical Constraints**: Limitations discovered that require architectural changes

#### üîß **Technical Evolution:**
- **Dependency Changes**: New libraries/tools that proved beneficial
- **Build System Updates**: Better build, test, or deployment approaches
- **Development Workflow**: Process improvements discovered during implementation
- **Quality Improvements**: Better testing, validation, or monitoring approaches

### 4. Update Proposed Final Manifest

#### Structural Updates:
- **New/Modified Files**: Add files discovered during implementation
- **Updated Exports**: Revise function signatures based on implementation learnings
- **Enhanced Architecture**: Update data flow and integration patterns
- **Dependency Revisions**: Add/remove/update dependencies based on experience
- **Configuration Changes**: Update settings, build, or deployment configuration

#### Content Quality:
- **API Signatures**: Update with actual parameter types and return values discovered
- **Integration Points**: Refine external system interactions based on reality
- **Error Handling**: Document improved error management patterns
- **Performance Characteristics**: Update with actual performance discoveries
- **Testing Approaches**: Incorporate better testing patterns discovered

### 5. Document Evolution in Manifest Evolution Log

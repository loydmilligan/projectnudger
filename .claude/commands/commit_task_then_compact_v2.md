## Task: Commit Task Implementation Then Compact Context

**Task ID:** [TASK_ID]

## Phase 1: Task Commit Process

### 1. Pre-Commit Verification
- Load validation report to confirm task completion status
- Verify all critical and concerning issues have been resolved
- Ensure no uncommitted debugging or temporary code remains
- Confirm all task-related files are ready for commit
- Check that build/compile succeeds if applicable

### 2. Update Baseline Manifest
**CRITICAL STEP:** Update the project's baseline manifest with actual state:
- Load the actual_manifest from validation report
- **Replace** codebase_manifest.json content with actual_manifest
- This establishes the new baseline for future tasks
- Verify the updated manifest is valid JSON/format
- Include manifest update in the commit

### 3. Stage All Task-Related Changes
Identify and stage all files changed during task implementation:
- New files created during implementation
- Modified files changed during implementation  
- Updated dependency files (package.json, etc.)
- Configuration files modified
- Documentation updates
- **Updated codebase_manifest.json**

Review staged changes to ensure only task-related modifications are included.

### 4. Create Descriptive Commit Message

**Format:** `[TASK_ID]: [Brief description]`

**Detailed Commit Body:**
```
[TASK_ID]: [Brief description]

Implementation Summary:
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2] 
- [Key change 3]

Files Created:
- [new_file1.ext] - [purpose]
- [new_file2.ext] - [purpose]

Files Modified:
- [existing_file1.ext] - [what changed]
- [existing_file2.ext] - [what changed]

Dependencies Added:
- [dependency1] - [reason]
- [dependency2] - [reason]

Validation Status: [PASS/MINOR_ISSUES]
Breaking Changes: [YES/NO - describe if yes]
Baseline Manifest Updated: YES
Task Completion: [percentage or status]

Ready for context compact and next development phase.
```

### 5. Execute Git Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m \"[TASK_ID]: [Brief description]\" -m \"[Detailed body]\"
```

### 6. Post-Commit Task Management
- Record commit hash for task tracking
- Move task preparation file to completed directory
- Update task status in tracking system
- Archive validation report with commit reference

### 7. Update Task Tracking
Move and update task files:
- Move `tasks/prepared/[TASK_ID].json` to `tasks/completed/[TASK_ID].json`
- Add commit information to completed task file
- Update tasks.json progress if applicable

## Phase 2: Context Compact Process

### 8. Verify Commit Success
**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** Only proceed to compact if commit was successful:
- [ ] Git commit completed successfully
- [ ] Commit hash recorded
- [ ] Baseline manifest updated
- [ ] Task files moved to completed directory
- [ ] Working directory is clean

**‚ùå STOP IF COMMIT FAILED** - Do not compact context if commit was unsuccessful

### 9. Prepare Next Development Context

#### Gather Essential State:
- **Project Overview**: Current project description and status
- **Codebase State**: Read updated codebase_manifest.json
- **Task Progress**: Read tasks.json with updated completion status
- **Git State**: Latest commit hash and clean working directory
- **Development Phase**: Current phase and remaining work

#### Identify Next Priority:
- **Next Task**: Determine next recommended task from tasks.json
- **Dependencies**: Verify next task dependencies are met
- **Phase Context**: Understand current development priorities
- **Blockers**: Any issues preventing next task start

### 10. Generate Comprehensive Context Prompt

Create detailed prompt for new Claude session:

```
# PROJECT DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT - [Project Name]

## Project Overview
- **Name**: [Project name]
- **Description**: [Brief project description]
- **Tech Stack**: [Current technology stack]
- **Development Status**: [Current phase and overall progress]

- claude-code implement_task \"Task-X.X\" - Implement prepared task  
- claude-code check_task \"Task-X.X\" - Validate implementation against expected
- claude-code commit_task \"Task-X.X\" - Commit and update baseline
- claude-code resolve_mismatch \"Task-X.X\" - Fix validation issues

**Optimization Commands:**
- claude-code update_final_manifest - Update architectural planning
